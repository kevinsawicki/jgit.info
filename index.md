# Introducing JGit

[JGit](http://eclipse.org/jgit/) is an open-source implementation of the
[Git](http://git-scm.com/) version control system written completely in Java.

It is licensed under the [Eclipse Distribution License](http://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/edl-v10.php)
and is developed under and distributed by the [Eclipse Foundation](http://eclipse.org/).

JGit supports accessing local Git repositories as well as synchronizing between 
repositories over a network using various protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, SFTP,
as well as the standard Git protocol.

JGit also implements several core version control components such as computing
differences and merging changes.

The JGit [overview](overview.html) provides more details about the project and
how it is structured and what libraries are needed by JGit.
